## Iman Malih - Murtatha Alwan - John Olton - Damla Duman



## Data Type:  
Healthcare – Covid-19


## Sources:

## Project Description: 

You are a scientist tasked to retrospectively prevent COVID-19 exposure and fatality. To do so, you must answer the following questions:

## Research Questions:
1. How did different countries do during the pandemic, and what made these results different?
2. How effective was the vaccination?
3. Did booster shots have any effect on exposure rates?
4. Which countries had the most deaths or tested most positive per population?
5. Which countries had the lowest fatalities?
6. What is the median age for those who tested positive?
7. Is the GDP correlated with positive tests?
8. How many people were tested positive for COVID-19 and hospitalized per country?
9. Is there a correlationbetween the countries gdp and the hospitilizations? 
10. Is there a direct correlation between diabetes and COVID-19 deaths?





## Analysis and Visuals:


## How did different countries do during the pandemic, and what made these results different?
   - The country that had the most positive cases for their population is
Denmark with %53.5 percent of its population contracting COVID-19.
   - The country that had the most COVID-19 deaths for their population is
Czechia with %0.39 percent of their population dying from COVID-19.
   - The country that had the least positive cases for their population is
South Africa with %6.66 percent of its population contracting COVID-19.
   - The country that had the least COVID-19 deaths for their population is
Japan with %0.025 percent of their population dying from COVID-19.

## How effective was the vaccination?

- Based on our analysis, the vaccinations had low correlation to the positive cases. This indicates the vaccination did not offer a dramatic decline in positive cases. The vaccines also had mild affect towards the covid related deaths. It does not indidcate that the vaccines effectively saved lives.

## Did booster shots have any effect on exposure rates?
   - There is a low positive correlation between the percentage of people getting the booster shot and the number of cases in that country.

## Which countries had the most deaths or tested most positive per population?
   - The highest number of fatalities were in Czechia. 


   
## Which countries had the lowest fatalities?
   - The lowest number of deaths per population were in Australia and Japan. 

   
## What is the median age for those who tested positive?
   - The average age of people who got tested positive were about 40.

## Is the GDP correlated with positive tests?
   - There is a negative-low correlation between the GDP vs the positive cases. There is more of a parabola.

## How many people were tested positive for COVID-19 and hospitalized per country? 
   - There is no correlation between the hospitalizations and the positive cases.

## Is there a correlation between the countries gdp and the hospitilizations? 
   - There is a low positive correlation between the number of hospitalizations and the GDP of a country.

## Is there a direct correlation between diabetes and COVID-19 deaths?
 -  There was no correlation between either diabetes prevalence and positive cases or deaths.
