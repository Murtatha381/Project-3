You are a scientist tasked to retrospectively prevent COVID-19 exposure and fatality. To do so you must answer the following questions:

Main Query: How did different countries do during the pandemic, and what made these results different?
Sub-Queries: 
- How effective was the vaccination? 
- Did booster shots have any effect on exposure rates?
- Which countries had the most deaths or tested  most positive per population? 
- Which countries had the lowest fatalities? 
- What is the median age for those who tested positive? 
- Is the GDP correlated with positive tests? 
- How many people were tested positive for COVID-19 and hospitalized per country? 
- Is there a direct correlation between diabetes and COVID-19 deaths?
