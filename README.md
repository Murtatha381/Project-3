## Data Type:  
Healthcare – Covid-19

## Project Description: 

You are a scientist tasked to retrospectively prevent COVID-19 exposure and fatality. To do so, you must answer the following questions:

## Research Questions:
1. How did different countries do during the pandemic, and what made these results different?
2. How effective was the vaccination?
3. Did booster shots have any effect on exposure rates?
4. Which countries had the most deaths or tested most positive per population?
5. Which countries had the lowest fatalities?
6. What is the median age for those who tested positive?
7. Is the GDP correlated with positive tests?
8. How many people were tested positive for COVID-19 and hospitalized per country?
9. Is there a correlationbetween the countries gdp and the hospitilizations? 
10. Is there a direct correlation between diabetes and COVID-19 deaths?

## How effective was the vaccination?

- Based on our analysis, the vaccinations had low correlation to the positive cases. This indicates the vaccination did not offer a dramatic decline in positive cases. The vaccines also had mild affect towards the covid related deaths. It does not indidcate that the vaccines effectively saved lives.
