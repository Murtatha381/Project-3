Story-Telling-Question: How effective was COVID-19 against demographics and countries?

Data Type:  Healthcare – Covid-19

Questions/Thoughts: Who was most susceptible? Underlying conditions? Country, Weight, Age, Gender, Vaccine, Lockdown, Comorbidity, Mortality Rate Pre/Post-Vaccination, Hospitalization

You are a scientist tasked to retrospectively prevent COVID-19 exposure and fatality. To do so you must answer the following questions:

How effective was the vaccination? 
Did booster shots have any effect on exposure rates?
Which continents/countries deaths or tested positive per population? 
Which continents/countries had the lowest fatalities? 
What is the mean and median age for those who tested positive? 
Is the GDP correlated with positive tests? 
How many people were tested positive for COVID-19 and hospitalized per country? 
Is there a direct correlation between cardiovascular and COVID-19 deaths?
Is there a direct correlation between diabetes and COVID-19 deaths?
